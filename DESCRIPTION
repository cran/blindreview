Description: Randomly assigns identification to one of the variables of the dataset, say Treatment,
   and assigns random numbers to all the observations of the dataset. Reorders the database according
   to the random numbers, and then runs the appropriate forward search function on the blinded dataset. 
   A file is created from which the user can identify any outliers using the graphics function in this
   package. An unmasking function is provided so that the user can identify the potential outliers in 
   terms of their original values when blinding is no longer needed. Details of the forward search 
   functions may be found in <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=forsearch>.
