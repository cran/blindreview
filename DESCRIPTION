Description: Randomly assigns identification to one of the variables of the dataset, say 
   Treatment, and assigns random numbers to all the observations of the dataset. 
   Reorders the observations according to the random numbers, and then runs the 
   appropriate forward search function on the blinded dataset. A file is created 
   from which the user can identify any outliers using the graphics function in 
   this package. Centers each fixed coefficient at the grand mean prior to 
   graphing in order to further mask the treatment. An unmasking function is 
   provided so that the user can identify the potential outliers in terms of their 
   original values when blinding is no longer needed. Details of the forward search 
   functions may be found in <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=forsearch>.
