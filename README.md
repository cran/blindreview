The goal of blindreview is to provide a review of a database after blinding the
    identity of the treatments and of the observation numbers. The outcome is a
    set of graphs that identify the best fitting observations and the worst
    fitting observations to the planned analysis of the data without also
    identifying the treatment that resulted in these observations. This forward
    search of the database is carried out using the forsearch package.
